### About

An experimental style of writing where I try to dump everything in my mind about random topics. This is a free flow of ideas with no structure or organization which can be written quickly - I usually set a timer for ten minutes and do it like brainstorming. These are not accurate and often I make guesses how things work a lot here. It is also inspired by the Feynman Technique of learning by explaining to others
