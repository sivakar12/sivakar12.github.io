### Background

A data exploration blog post I am doing as part of the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree This is a dataset of AirBnB listings in Seattle. It has details about the prices, ratings, host information, amenities provided by the property etc. I looked at the amenities provided and also see how they react with price and ratings. 

Used popular data science tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn etc. There is a Jupyter Notebook and a Gatsby site with 
the blog post
