I am a full-stack developer with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering and two years of experience in the industry.

I have experience working with a diverse array of platforms, tools and programming languages. In my time in the industry, I have build several single-page web applications, managed back end code and databases, worked with cloud components and did DevOps related work. I have also on the side built some portfolio projects on the side.

From my work with single-page interactive web applications, I have solid JavaScript experience. I have done data science projects for university and in online courses which gave me Python experience. I can learn languages fast. There is a portfolio project in which I did while simultaneously learning the programming language Elm. I have done code challenges in Rust. I recently made an Android application having not touched Java for years. 

I consider this ability to learn news thing fast my biggest strength. I am mostly self-taught. I think this enables me to adapt to the fast changing tech landscape. I can quickly read and understand documentation. I see overlapping patterns and commonalities across tools which is what allows me to learn so quickly. 

I can work fast with discipline and responsibility. I pay attention to both the tiny details and the big picture. My code is neat and easy to maintain. I have good communication skills allowing me to express my ideas clearly and to understand what is am told properly.

Outside CS, I am interested in economics, history, psychology, geopolitics and linguistics. My long term goal is to contribute to solving big problems like climate change, mental health and inequality.
