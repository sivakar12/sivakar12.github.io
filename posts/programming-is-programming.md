Programming is programming. 

It always baffles me when I see jobs listed for Java Developers, PHP Devlopers, .NET Programmers. I really don't buy into this idea that these are so different from one another. They all have so much in common than they are different. A for loop is a for loop in all languages. The systax is a surface level thing. 

Besides, when someone sings up for such a job, they are never going to be doing just that. Everybody has to work with a whole variety o tools. They have to deal with libraries that they never learned before. They have to use so many cross cutting things like Databases, Version control etc.

A web server is a web server regardless of which language it is built in. It handles cookies, routing, data mapping, caching etc. The difference is in surface level only. These concepts are what matters - not the language and the little specifics which are just a Google search away

Take front end developement. Front end development is not about knowing React API or Angular API. A front end developer's work is breaking the app into components, organising the state (knowing what to put in the top and which remain encapsulated inside components.

A programmer's job is not knowing the syntax and API's by heart. A programmer's job is to know how to split the code into modules, anticipate error conditions and handle them beforehand, decreasing complexity, increasing cohesion, decresing coupling, giving good variable names, making code readable. This is a timeless concept. This is applicable to all kind of development, across all paradigms.
