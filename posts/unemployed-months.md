[Draft 1]

I was unemployed for several months in 2021. I was unemployed but I wasn't unproducive.

I kind of got disillusioned with the work looking at how the collective humanity was responding to Covid. I also got the strong feeling that the world is going to change for good, just like what happened by the end of the World War II. I knew I have to level up and reinvent myself if I have to find any kind of success in the new world.

#### Dogma

Dogma is the thing which are things that are taken for granted but don't come from solid principles. They work under assumptions and when the assumptions are not valid anymore they don't work. Examples of dogma include that certificates are what matters, one must not have a gap in the CV to be taken seriuosly. I don't buy those things.

Another most cited thing is that only experts are allowed to have opinions on certain subjects. If only experts are entitled for professional opinion, then how does democracy or free market work. They are based on the idea that the voter knows best and the consumer knows best. 

So I took the bulk of my time away from tech and looked at various other subjects like economics, geopolitics, philosophy, psychology. But I did some computer science work on the side so that I don't lose touch

#### Computer Science

I am a programmer only mostly. I wanted to see if it would be possible for me to pivot to Data Science at some point. There was the Udacity Nanodegree program on discount and I did one in a really quick time paying really less. I made a lot of small but complete side projects, some using new tech stacks I wasn't using before. I made Minesweeper game clone in Elm. I made a small Visual Studio Code extension. I build a React Native app that I now use on a daily basis for my own productivity.

So I had the reassurance that I am still in that game.

#### Philosophy

Like I said before, I was disillusined with the world and needed some answers to big questions. I looked at a lot of philosophical concepts and the works of many people but maybe on a shallow level. I had already been looking at those ideas for several years.

Stoicism was a good guiding philosophy. I also liked what Fredrich Nietzsche had to say. I read and watched a lot and I thought a lot.

#### Phychology

Psychology is what I needed to understand people. The pandemic showed just how immportant it is. ALthough we had a lot of scientific information, making people behahve in that rational way is near impossible. (I myself am a bit guilty of that). 

Freud, I learned a long time ago. Then I did learn about Carl Jung. I hung out in a few subreddits. I read a lot of articles and books. 
I realized how the soccial media and marketing makes use of psychology.

#### Economy

I don't get to live the way I want and do that job I want because of economy. The system. I have been very angry at how modern capitalism worked. I know Capitalism did play its role in a lot of progressive outcomes but I have been really bothered by all these bubbles I keep seeing everywhere. And modern Capitalism in my view just keeps solving easy problems, with litle foregight in my opinion. The most pressing issues of today are climate change, mental health and inequality there is very litte done by Capitalism on these.

I learned about the very fundamenals in economics like opportunity cost, demand and supply, comparative advantage, value, etc. I found myself applying a lot of these thing in my day-to-day decision making thigns as well.

I leanred about the countries' economics. I started seeing the forest instead of the trees. It was really illuminating and I believe that they will help me for many many years into the future.

#### Geopolitics

The last time the world order changed for good was at the end of the World War II. I believe that we are at such a watershed moment now at the end of Covid 19. I read a few really good books. I was reading the news a lot. Was going through some really high quality Reddit threads. THey gave me so much valuable framework to understand how the world works.

#### Communication Skills

I have been really introveted and reclusive most of my life. I am only now learning to convert my thoughts to words, when it become clear how many doors communication skills can open. 

I journaled extensively. For hundreds of hours. I was writing down everything that went into my head. The process was very theraupitic. I enjoyed the process. And I learned in the process.

I was experimenting on social media. I was getting a lot of engagement and validation, although small. I was really into variety and I found people liking and appriciating me for what I have been sharing.

#### Brain training

Foreign languages can do a lot of good to the brain. Just like how one exerises the body, one's brain needs to be exercised too. Thanks to Duolingo, I learned a lot of French. 

I spend a lot of time in brain training apps, beating record after record, unlocking achievements after achievements. I know I am planting seeds that will bear fruit down the road.

#### Long Term Benefits

The relatively good sucess that I have today is the result of the work I did many many years ago. The pay off for a lot of good work comes many years down the line. The things I did now I believe are going to be rewarding me in a pleasantly surprising ways.
