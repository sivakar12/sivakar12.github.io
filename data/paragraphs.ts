Writing software is an art. You can solve the same problem in countless ways but all solutions are not the same. Good solutions require more than bare minimum work. It takes a lot of thoughtful decisions. I write code that has low coupling and high cohesion, looking several steps ahead, so my work in the future flows smoothly, others can understand my work easily and it is possible to organically build on top of it. I consider this aspect more important than knowing languages and frameworks.
Still, I know languages and frameworks. I have always been a quick learner. In school, I mastered things like Integral Calculus and Organic Chemistry in a month. It on took me a month to internalize the fundamentals of Java. I can spot patterns across subjects that help me learn things easily. For example, my knowledge of Node.js and Laraval allowed me to get up to speed on Spring so easily. I spent months internalizing React concepts but then I could that learn Vue in a matter of days.
In places where I have worked, I am often entrusted with prototypes, MVPs, and proof-of-concept software. I work very fast. I have a good command of written language and I am good at making notes that are concise and complete. Both for my brainstorming and for communication.
I have several interests outside CS. Economics, psychology, and linguistics to name a few. I practice mindfulness, learn foreign languages, read a lot, and maintain fitness all to improve my cognitive abilities. I am driven by the curiosity to learn about human civilization and to contribute to human civilization in any meaningful way possible.

I am a full-stack developer with both theoretical knowledge and extensive practical experience. I hold a university degree in Computer Science and Engineering and have strong foundations in mathematics. My work spans a diverse range of codebases, allowing me to develop practical skills and adapt to various environments. Every day is different in my profession, bringing new problems that require creative solutions. Similar to how a neural network improves with diverse data, I have exposed myself to various environments, requirements, and tools, enabling me to recognize patterns that apply effectively across different domains, including frontend, backend, CI/CD, and emerging technologies of the future. 
Earlier, I excelled at learning libraries and programming languages, delving deep into APIs and coding from memory. However, with the rapid release of new libraries and frameworks, and the advent of AI assistants, I have reinvented myself. Now, I focus on learning as needed, quickly moving from problem identification to utilizing the right tools.
I expose myself to various subjects outside of Computer Science, believing that diverse knowledge and experiences enhance my problem-solving abilities. I read extensively on productivity, economics, and psychology, learn foreign languages, practice mindfulness, and play puzzle games. I am always on the lookout for new techniques to improve my problem-solving skills.
I believe I have more skills than my experience reflects due to limited opportunities to showcase them. I am eager for this job to demonstrate my full potential and will work diligently to exceed expectations. I am committed to bringing my best to your team and growing with [Company Name], showing my loyalty and dedication through consistently high performance and a drive to succeed.
