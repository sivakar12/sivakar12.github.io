Programming is programming. 

It always baffles me when I see jobs listed for Java Developers, PHP Developers, .NET Programmers, etc. I really don't buy into this idea that these are so different from one another. They all have so much in common than they are different. A for loop is a for loop in all languages. All Turing languages are there for the same reason. The syntax is a surface-level thing. 

Besides, when someone signs up for such a job, they are never going to be doing just that. Everybody has to work with a whole variety of tools. They have to deal with libraries that they never learned before. They have to use so many cross-cutting things like Databases, Version control, etc.

A web server is a web server regardless of which language it is built in. It handles cookies, routing, data mapping, caching, etc. The difference is in surface-level only. These concepts are what matters - not the language and the little specifics which are just a Google search away

Take front-end development. Front-end development is not about knowing React API or Angular API. A front-end developer's work is breaking the app into components, organizing the state (knowing what to put in the top and which remain encapsulated inside components).

One could argue that there is expertise that comes from working with something for a long time. But things are changing so fast in day and age that we get new languages, frameworks, libraries, runtimes at an astounding rate. It is hard to keep up with the details - not sustainable. What we can keep in our minds are patterns and concepts. They are timeless.

A programmer's job is not knowing the syntax and APIs by heart. A programmer's job is to know how to split the code into modules, anticipate error conditions and handle them beforehand, decreasing complexity, increasing cohesion, decreasing coupling, giving good variable names, making code readable. This is a timeless concept. They are multi-domain. This applies to all kinds of development, across all paradigms.

So programming is programming whether it is done for CLIs, web servers, IoT, blockchain, game engines, or DoM. It is just looking at the requirements, understanding the constraints, reading documentation, coding, debugging, saving and running the code somewhere.

    shortDescription: "How I used my voluntary unemployment period",
    contentMarkdown: `
I was unemployed for several months in 2021. I was unemployed but I wasn't unproductive.

I kind of got disillusioned with the world looking at how the collective humanity was responding to Covid. I also got a strong feeling that the world is going to change for good. And I was very anxious about my job security. I knew I have to level up and reinvent myself if I have to find any kind of success in the new world. I took a bold step and quit my job and decided to work on myself.

One thing people kept saying is that a gap in the CV will not look good. I have to explain why I was out of action. I say that statement is dogma and this post is my explaining everything I did in my unemployed days.

#### Dogma

Dogmas are rules that are taken for granted but aren't derived from solid principles. They work under assumptions and when the assumptions are not valid anymore they don't work. That one should be employed without break is a dogma. That certificates are all that matters is a dogma. I am unconventional and I don't like these dogmas.

Another popular dogma is that only experts are allowed to have opinions on certain subjects and you should stick to the subjects of your profession. If only experts are entitled to a professional opinion, then how does democracy or free market work. They are based on the idea that the voter knows best and the consumer knows best. I say that as long as I am following logic and facts, I can learn anything and comment on anything.

So I took the bulk of my time away from tech and looked at various other subjects like economics, geopolitics, philosophy and psychology. But I did some computer science work on the side so that I don't lose touch.

I had saved most of what I had earned in the last two years. I am financially secure. So from a common-sense angle also it was a reasonable decision to take time off work.

#### Can't escape the economy

I don't get to live the way I want and do that job I want because of the economy. I have been very angry at how modern capitalism worked. I know Capitalism did play its role in a lot of progressive outcomes but I have been bothered by all these bubbles I keep seeing everywhere. And modern Capitalism, in my view, just keeps solving easy problems, with litle foresight in my opinion. The most pressing issues of today are climate change, mental health and inequality there is very little done by Capitalism on these.

I learned about the very fundamentals in economics like opportunity cost, demand and supply, comparative advantage, value, etc. I found myself applying a lot of these things in my day-to-day decision making as well.

I learned about the countries' economics. I started seeing the forest instead of the trees. It was illuminating and I believe that they will help me for many many years into the future.

#### Understanding the world order

The last time the world order changed for good was at the end of World War II. I believe that we are at such a watershed moment now at the end of Covid 19. I read a few really good books. I was reading the news a lot - reading the news, reading the analysis and analysing the things on my own, to for the kind of framework to explain how the world worked.

#### Searching for meaning in philosophy

Like I said before, I was disillusioned with the world and needed some answers to big questions. I looked at a lot of philosophical concepts and the works of many people but maybe on a shallow level. I had already been looking at those ideas for several years.

Stoicism was a good guiding philosophy. It helped me live through all the hard things that were thrown at me, every day. I also liked what Fredrich Nietzsche had to say. I read and watched a lot and I thought a lot. Thinking is the hallmark of philosophy.

#### Psychology and neuroscience

I needed psychology to understand people. The pandemic showed just how important it is. Although we had a lot of scientific information, making people behave rationally is near impossible. (I, myself, am a bit guilty of that).

Freud, I learned a long time ago. Then I did learn about Carl Jung. I hung out in a few subreddits. I read a lot of articles and books. I realized how much social media and marketing makes use of psychology and how these ideas are used to shape the human collective. I found new tricks to be more productive. I learned a lot about human nature. I trained myself to be more empathetic to people, improved my emotional intelligence.

#### I wanted to find my voice and get it across to other people

I have been highly introverted and reclusive most of my life. I am only now learning to convert my thoughts to words when it became clear how many doors communication skills can open.

I journaled extensively. For hundreds of hours. I was writing down everything that went into my head. The process was very therapeutic. I enjoyed the process. And I learned in the process.

I was experimenting with social media. I was getting a lot of engagement and validation, although from a small group of people, I know they liked the things I post because of their inherent value. I was really into a variety and I found people liking and appreciating me for what I have been sharing. It helped me beat a lot of my discomfort in sharing my ideas.

#### Unlocking new parts of the brain

Foreign languages can do a lot of good to the brain. Just like how one exercises the body, one's brain needs to be exercised too. Thanks to Duolingo, I learned a lot of French, which is good for my personality and my brain.

I spend a lot of time in brain training apps, beating record after record, unlocking achievements after achievements. 

Neuroplasticity is something that is not well known but super important. I know I am planting seeds that will bear fruit down the road.

#### Not forgetting Computer Science

I needed to have some work to show that I still am in the coding game. I made a lot of small but complete side projects, some using new tech stacks I haven't used before. I made a Minesweeper game clone in Elm. I made a small Visual Studio Code extension. I build a React Native app that I now use daily for my productivity.

I am a programmer mostly. I wanted to see if it would be possible for me to pivot to Data Science at some point. I took a couple of courses in Udacity that were in discount and completed one in a very quick time.

#### Long Term Benefits

The relatively good success that I have today is the result of the work I did many many years ago. The payoff for a lot of good work comes many years down the line. The things I am doing now, I believe are, going to reward me in pleasantly surprising ways as I rise.

You plant seeds and trees grow from them and give you fruits.

There are a lot of productive things that you can do today that will give you a lot of benefits down the road. But often they are chores and you don't really get the motivation to do them. You only want to do things that will make you happy right now. Reading books, sitting down and writing, using that brain training app - they are all good but you don't feel like doing them when you don't know how much to do and when to stop.

We need a way to trick our brain into believing that we are getting some instant reward for doing these tasks and we need to get clear goals.

Enter Forest. Forest is based on timers and it has this planting analogy. You start the countdown timer which puts a virtual seed. The times can be any multiple of five, with a minimum of ten. I mostly use 10 or 25. Then until the time is up, you force yourself to do that only task you started doing.

In addition to this, the app shows statistics that make you want to beat your own records. You can see total times clocked only daily, weekly, monthly and yearly basis. You get this urge to beat your own records. 'Just a little more, just some more to make this a good day' you tell yourself.

I have now used this app for three whole years now. It is one of the best lifestyle changes I made.

[DRAFT 1]
Journaling transformed my life. I got a lot less stressfull. I got more creative. My ability to plan got a big boost. It was like I have upgraded my hardware. I got more RAM in my head.

I got to articulate thing well. That gave me a breakthrough in my social status and career. I had this problem all my life. I had thoughts and I could not put them to words. I always could get ideas. But I was not getting it across to people.

When I write my journals, I go on a freewheeling ride. I don't think about paragarpahs. I don't want ot edit. I write things the way they go. No overthinking. The style is something I discovered on my own. Things fell in place without me realing. I was amazed and proud. I had collected all these ideas and knowledge over the year. But only now I am seeing them written done.

It was liberating experience. Before this everytime I try to write, I overthink and overwhelm myself. I am stuck editing. Maybe the editing featurs that come with comptutes isn't always a blessing. I always wanted everyting to be perfect that I was thinking of the output, the product when typing. But journaling made me realize the process is all about dealing with the thoughts in the mind. And working to ther this. There is no audience. It is about going where the mind is taking me. It wasn't coherent at first. But I evolved quickly. I write really good stuff.

I don't write to read. But I have a whole stash. I go revisit them sometimes. I see how fa I have come. Language is the single biggest human invention. But so many of us as so bad at it. I was bad at ti. But I got it. No big tool was requied. A simple app. Pen and paper would have done the deal too.

[DRAFT 1]
It took a lot of trial and error for me to crack how to use Notion. But when everything finally clicked, a huge weight was lifted off my head.

The first big breakthrough came when I want to deal with my axieties by creating a database for all the things. I added things in sparotically. And then I saw that for each item, I can add notes piece by piece, again at irregular intervals. Whenever I was in the mood for it. 

I had gotten better at brainstorming with bullet points. I was using it mostly for work. Then I got to add them to Notion to collect them in one place. I loved how the notes you want to make can be very simple or very elaborate. For complex things, you could page inside page inside page.

I then created a database for all the long term goals. Todo lists never worked for me. Trials and error thee always left me anxious. Things getting long there made me feel bad, put a lot of pressrure. Every thing there is either not done or done. There are deadlien too. 

Then I watched a video that resonated with me. About how deadlines and plans based on time are bad. I just have to work on what I feel like. Take the task I am just in the mood for and get into the flow state. When I did it with Notion, having a database for each long term task, I woudl do soemethign adn put notes. Them collecting. 

This was I got to feel good every time I did something for the long term task. I was breaking it down to pieces in a nice way. I was feeling delighted when the notes got bigger and the task got longer. Before that if something is getting bigger, I would start feeling overwhelmed. Now I feel I can freely go deep into something. This inversion is the greatest thigns that supercharged my productivity.

Then I got into the Notion's in-house template for Project and everything is task. It is better than what i did on my own. I am dealing with a hundred parallal task. Some tasks are just braingtroming. Some tasks are about changing habits and go on for months. Some are about coding. Some are bureaucracy. 

I am now all set to conquer the world of complexity with the new tricks and techniques of oraganization I am fine-tuning  every day.
