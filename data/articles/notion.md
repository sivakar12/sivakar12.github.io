Civilization is a result of organization. Advanced economics are productive because of organization. If I want to taste big successes in life, I needed to organize everything about my life. I have been doing random things by trial and error but when I got a system in place with Notion, I was able to do things I considered incredibly hard so easily.

To transform my life, I needed to execute a lot of long term task and build new habits. But the problem is two fold. One is that I want to do many things at once. The other is I can only accomplish a small part. You get the advice to break things down everywhere. But how exactly to do that, for your unique situation no one tells you. Maybe no one can. So it is all a lot of brainstorming and information collecting and knowledge serach. 

The first proper use of Notion was when I went from reading one book at a time to another. I was reading one book at a time. But then I got this eye opening advice on YouTube that you have to really read multiple books in paralle. This woman told me that you should read what you are in mood for. That was when I went for Notion's board style database to have books in 'Not Starated', 'In Progress' and 'Done' columns. That way I can have the freedom to do thing self-paced and parallel way taht is so natural to how I learn.

Then from some other advice, I was making a database of anxieties I had. It was transformative. The way I was getting things to a databse and then coming at random times to add new items and notes to existing items, I realized I was solving a lot of my life's problems easily. Things in head are hrad to gapple with. In a database, it is so easy. A lot of problems were disappering.

Then I realized this is the way to deal with habits. The system of tracking habits by forcing myself to add ticks or counts was wrong. It was painful. I just need to make a big database all my lifes long term goals. I did some recording and I hit hundred. There, this is why things were so burdensome. How do you focus on all those things floating in your head.

Much tinkering a later, things developed to a system. I have a list of projects. There are tasks. Taks are not like what you have in a todo app. That is not something you can do and tick off. These required to try something, brainstorm, face problems, then mark them. I had a brainstorming system of using bullet points. And that fit perfectly in the Notion page. This a page you can write everyting. There is structure for somethings. And no structure for other things.

I have projects for my health, for the things I have to learn, for travel and bureaucrazy, for the software I am building. In the projects there are tasks. Tasks go for days or months. New ideas go as new tasks only if they are big enough. Otherwise they go into existing list of tasks. At a time I have a hundred or so tase in progress. Tasks are in projects. Projects have databases and thing even.

I get to abandon tasks a lot. With todos, you have to delete hem. I hate doing that -- losing records. That was another reason that I didn't want to go for todo. The OCD part in me dodn't want to crate the tasks that would end up deleted. Here I have freedom. I fail and I delete.

I now go to the task list every day. Add short new information. It is a freewheeling brainstomr. I ask why I am procrastinating and make note about that. What to do next? I want to read this text book, I go to hat taks, mark what time i am starting and read, when I get concepts I have hard time udnerstand, I write down and brainstorm and find hte way. I have some bureaucrazy I have to handle, I put the setps and when I will recive the next. If i have to contact somebo

Rigid plans don't work. You can't predict what happens when. You don't want to do things you are not in the mood for. You have to react to things only. But when you have so much information available, you just can find somethign out of the whole list taht you have to, act on it for a little, makes notes adn plans and stop. This little progresses at random times keep you moving forward
