title: Asynchronous Communication
hidden: false
shortDescription: Why I hate meetings and prefer emails
---
My preferred working style is communicate everything through written text. Emails and messages. You think and organize information and share. When responding, you take a lot of time to get ideas and then send good ones.

I hate meetings. I doze off. I can't focus. They waste my time. I hated it for a long time. Now I have the idea why that is the case.

I don't know how it works in the western world. I see in the movies and TV that people sit around table and do everything spontaneously. Does it really work like this in real life?

The more time you give your brain, the more ideas it cam come up with, right? You can go through many options and scenarios in the head and ideas compete and the best one triumps? Isn't it common sense? It happens to me that way? I get the best ideas when walking and showring. There is something about focused mode and scaatterd mode of thinking and dcreative ideas arrive in scattered mode. Heard of the book Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daneil Kahneman? 

Thinking is best done alone -- at least for me. Then there is the idiom, "sleep over something". That there is an idiom like this shows a lot of people get good ideas after sleeping. I don't know, it doesn't work for me. (I am a night owl who wakes up tired). All of it shows, we are not designed to give an answer for things right away.

What is modern white collar work anyway? Solving problems. YOu define the problem, maybe break the problem to smaller problem? Each thing gets assigned to smoebody. And they have to get the best solution and they give the ideas. All of this fits written communication prefectly. 

Like the async code you write in Node.js or in reactive programming. You give the instruction and move to the other things without waiting for the response. When the response comes, in its own time, you deal with it and do more. 

This is efficiency. This is productivity.
