Ideas
- It is trial and error. Got to a super efficient system.
- I have a database of doubts in Notion
- The output is usually a lot and not really needed. Way too obvious. If you ask, you get mini-Wikipedia. That is not a big problem. THat is how I used to learn before.
- But now we have something so much better. So much more productive.
- Ask specific things. Explain what I know. Guessing when I have to. Mistakes are ok. Give a lot of information. Mind dump basically. With guesses, questions and sometimes stating the obvious.
- Then it answers with what I am missing and what I need to know.
- Reading that I get more questions. I add to the next batch of questions.
- This is an active process. Not passive reading. More excitement. More change of being in the flow state. Better to commit to memory.
- I get to guess. That is creativity. This is exercise in bringing back fuzzy memories.
- I consolidate what I know already. Repitition helps. Smart repition. I get more confident with what I know. They are brought up in cache or soemthing.
- Language and articulation skills improve. Richard Feynman said that that you don't know unless you can explain in simple terms.
