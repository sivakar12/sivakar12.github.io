Ideas
- It is trial and error. Got to a super efficient system.
- I have a database of doubts in Notion
- The output is usually a lot and not really needed. Way too obvious. If you ask, you get mini-Wikipedia. That is not a big problem. THat is how I used to learn before.
- But now we have something so much better. So much more productive.
- Ask specific things. Explain what I know. Guessing when I have to. Mistakes are ok. Give a lot of information. Mind dump basically. With guesses, questions and sometimes stating the obvious.
- Then it answers with what I am missing and what I need to know.
- Reading that I get more questions. I add to the next batch of questions.
- This is an active process. Not passive reading. More excitement. More change of being in the flow state. Better to commit to memory.
- I get to guess. That is creativity. This is exercise in bringing back fuzzy memories.
- I consolidate what I know already. Repitition helps. Smart repition. I get more confident with what I know. They are brought up in cache or soemthing.
- Language and articulation skills improve. Richard Feynman said that that you don't know unless you can explain in simple terms.


## Draft #1
After a lot of trial and error, I have a process now, on how to learn with LLM.

First the process. I work based off doubts. I have a list of douts in my notetaking app. I keep adding qestions and concepts there. Then when I am in the right mood, I start with that doubt and go down the rabbit hole. I ask questions. A lot of questions at once. Bullet points are the keys. I put too many things at once. What I know. What I ghink I know. What I want to know. Then it replies. The replies cause more doubts in me. Some things are cleared. I send back more bullet points. Things I learned, I sent as paraphrased thigns. The more doubts, I put. I read the big output it gives and I make question and the next response. 

Now the why part? This doubts based approach. That is because I want to leanr only what I don't know. So effetive. Books and Wikipedia, give you too much. An OCD person like me, want to read all top to bottom. Then about batch questiosn. The LLM responses are big. And they take time. Many things at once, means, the big response contains only what I want and it also gets some understanding what I wnat. The writing much and guessing adn paraphrasitn. It is me learning to articulate. And you can't know something when you can't explain ti youself.

It is a totaly active process. Very much engaging. I love reading. but this is better than reading I found. This is exhausting. i do only a few sessions a day. All parts of the brain used. But I feel good in the end.
