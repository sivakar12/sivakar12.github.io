I knew LLMs were going to change the way I learn. I knew it the first time I used it. I was using it to learn for a long time. But it took a few years for me to crack the most effective way of doing it. I finally have a system and I am now cruising. Very fast I am moving, filling the gaps in my knowledge.

The process works like this. I have a database of doubts I have in my note-taking system. Each entry is a question, a single statement or a concept. I get into a chat session only when I am in the right mood and pick one off the database. I use bullet points in all my chats. I get all that is in my mind at that moment into many bullet points. Questions, questions related to the previous question, guesses of answers, my own hypotheses, names of concepts etc.. I get more questions as I write questions. Mistakes are OK. Stating the obvious is fine. Then I send all of it into the LLM. It replies with big text. As I read, I start the other batch of bullet points. I write more questions these cause in me. I paraphrase things that I just read. I type as I read. Then I may add even more things. Basically every batch is a big brain dump. Then I send. It replies with answers. This thing repeats a fair number of times. When I know I have a clear picture, I stop and cross the topic off the database. I don't let it go too long. If I get doubts in the future, they go as new entries and a new chat. In the new chat things might repeat, but that is fine. I type and type and typing is where most time is spent. LLM processes it pretty quickly. It is as if I am the one doing most of the work.

Now to explain this process... First for the batches, the LLM usually gives a long answer. One can tell it to be short, but given the problem to be solved, if we are doing short answers, we will have many back and forth messages and it will be slow and the waiting can stop the flow of thinking. I want to get out all the things in my head so leaving them for later won’t work. You know that feeling when you read books and Wikipedia articles, and you get more and more doubts and you can’t hold them in your head. (And in the old way, the answers for each are so far away, so many steps away. That is zig-zag but this is linear. No cognitive overload from context switching). With batches, I am giving in context about what I know and where I am weak. It will then know exactly what I need. When I make guesses and paraphrase, I am being an active learner and not a passive reader. Stating the obvious might seem a waste of time. But I want to follow the logical flow. I am thinking out loud. Repetition is actually productive here. It helps consolidate what I already know. I want to be validated and I gain a confidence boost from that. When I make guesses on what I think something is, how something works, I am also pulling things out of my memory. It is an exercise in bringing back fuzzy memories. I learn to be articulate. I learn to be simple. If you can't explain something in simple terms, you don't know that concept.

AI is not here to make me lazy. I don’t treat AI as something that will do work for me. I am doing the work and AI is making it faster. Here AI is a tool. My brain is what I want to sharpen. I am making full use of my creative mind, my logical mind and my memory.

So, this is a fun yet intense process now. I feel exhausted in the end. I get a full brain workout. I can do only a few sessions a day. But it is so rewarding and so engaging compared to just reading. I am a lifelong learner. My learning process got many times faster now with LLMs.
