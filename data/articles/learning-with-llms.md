Ideas
- It is trial and error. Got to a super efficient system.
- I have a database of doubts in Notion
- The output is usually a lot and not really needed. Way too obvious. If you ask, you get mini-Wikipedia. That is not a big problem. THat is how I used to learn before.
- But now we have something so much better. So much more productive.
- Ask specific things. Explain what I know. Guessing when I have to. Mistakes are ok. Give a lot of information. Mind dump basically. With guesses, questions and sometimes stating the obvious.
- Then it answers with what I am missing and what I need to know.
- Reading that I get more questions. I add to the next batch of questions.
- This is an active process. Not passive reading. More excitement. More change of being in the flow state. Better to commit to memory.
- I get to guess. That is creativity. This is exercise in bringing back fuzzy memories.
- I consolidate what I know already. Repitition helps. Smart repition. I get more confident with what I know. They are brought up in cache or soemthing.
- Language and articulation skills improve. Richard Feynman said that that you don't know unless you can explain in simple terms.


## Draft #1
After a lot of trial and error, I have a process now, on how to learn with LLM.

First the process. I work based off doubts. I have a list of douts in my notetaking app. I keep adding qestions and concepts there. Then when I am in the right mood, I start with that doubt and go down the rabbit hole. I ask questions. A lot of questions at once. Bullet points are the keys. I put too many things at once. What I know. What I ghink I know. What I want to know. Then it replies. The replies cause more doubts in me. Some things are cleared. I send back more bullet points. Things I learned, I sent as paraphrased thigns. The more doubts, I put. I read the big output it gives and I make question and the next response. 

Now the why part? This doubts based approach. That is because I want to leanr only what I don't know. So effetive. Books and Wikipedia, give you too much. An OCD person like me, want to read all top to bottom. Then about batch questiosn. The LLM responses are big. And they take time. Many things at once, means, the big response contains only what I want and it also gets some understanding what I wnat. The writing much and guessing adn paraphrasitn. It is me learning to articulate. And you can't know something when you can't explain ti youself.

It is a totaly active process. Very much engaging. I love reading. but this is better than reading I found. This is exhausting. i do only a few sessions a day. All parts of the brain used. But I feel good in the end.

## Structure for Draft 2
- First an intro
- Then just the process. How I do it.
- Then the reasons
- Final positive saying about exciting and active and rewarding

## Draft 2

First time I tried chatting with an LLM, I knew I was going to use this to learn. It took a couple of years for me to crack the most effective way of doing it. I finally have a system and I am cruising.

It works like this. I have a database of doubts I have in my notetaking system. Each entry is a single statement, topic or a question? I get into a chat session only when I am in the right mood and pick one off the database. I use bullet points in all my chats. I try and get all that is in my mind at that moment into many bullet points. Doubts, guesses the answers, questions on related questions. I get more questions as I write questions. Then I send all of it into the LLM. It replies with big test. As I read, I start the other batch of bullet points. I write more questions these bring in me. I paraphrase things that I jsut read, more questios. I type as I read. Then I may add even more things. Brain dump. Then I send. This things repeats a fair number of times. When I know I have a clear picture, I stop and cross of the database. I don't let it go too long. If I get doubts in the future, they go as new entries and more chat. There I wour probably add what I learnd that I can get out of my head.

The reasons are these. First for the batches, the LLM usually gives a long answer. One can tell it to beshort, but given the problem to be solved, if we are doing short answers, we will have many back and forth things. And it is slow. We have to wait. It is costly. With batches, I am giving in context what I know and where I am weak. Lots of ways it can find out my exact need. When I makes guess and paraphrasing, I am giving my brain a workout. I don't want to be the lazy person that let AI do everything. AI is a tool. My brain is what I want to sharpen. So I am engaging my creative mind, my logical mind and my memory when I make guesses on what I think something is, how something works. I learn to be articulate. I learn to be simple. If you can't explain something simply, you don't know that concept.

So, this is a fun and intense process now. I feel exhausted in the end. Brain workout. But I is so rewarding and so engaging compared to just reading. I am a lifelong learner. My learning process got manifold faster now with LLMs.

[In the next draft try and add an example. Or topic I have tried.]
