title: System Design
---
- What is System Design?
  - Deciding on the servers in a backend system and how they communicate
- Load Balancing
  - One server cannot handle all request when traffic is high
  - Load balancer receives the request and sends to the 
  - Some situation require stickiness 
    - Same client always has to connect to the same server for a session
      - Load balancer with a good cache algorith can do that based on inputs
    - If it is possible to avoid this, the better
      - Can use JWT reduce the need for server state
- Cache
  - How they help?
    - Reduce database queries which require disk access and 
  - In Memory Caches
    - Redis
  - Cache policies
    - What to throw away when cache is full
- Database scaling
  - Sharding
    - Separate data based on certain fields. And putting in different servers
    - Not always possible to cleanly separate if there are dependencies
      - Possible ways to separate are user, tenant, region etc.
  - CAP theorem
    - When you want partition tolerence, (which is always), you can either have availability or consistency
    - Eventual consistence is accepting brief periods of stale data
    - Consensus algorithms
- API manager
  - Multiple functions
    - Security checks
    - Presenting client end points and access multiple services for tha
    - Rate limiting and user procing
- Event bus
  - Decouplesd ways to have multiple servers keep in sync
  - System can put post events and move on to other ways
  - Events are stored safely in database until they are delivered
  - Event sourcing based data modeling
    - Immutable events are added
    - State can be derived anytime and if lost
- CQRS
  - Fanout
    - Data is stored in one database and what is needed for the view is put in another database
    - Social media posts are parts of write database and read databases handle news feed
- Failure handling
- Notifications systems
- Chat systems
  - Need to keep live sessions
    - Call web server to get a URL to the live server, then connect to that
