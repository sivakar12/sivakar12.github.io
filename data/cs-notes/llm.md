title: Large Language Models (LLMs)
---
- What is a large language model?
  - AI models that deal with language information trained huge billions of parameters
- How they work?
  - Basically matrix multiplication
- Important concepts
  - Tokenization
  - Embedding
    - Token to vector where the vectors have meaning
      - Same Similar thi 
  - Transformers
    - Use words in the context, to enrich each token with more meaning
      - Done in many iterations
  - Attention mechanism
    - Deciding which words in the context to attend to
- Types of LLMs
  - Translators
    - String of tokens as input and string of tokens as output
  - Generators
    - Given a starting piece, predict the next token.
      - Done recursively to generate long text  
- Famous models
  - Word2Vec
  - BART
  - GPT
