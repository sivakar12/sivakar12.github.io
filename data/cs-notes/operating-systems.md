- What is an OS?
  - A software providing platform for other softwares and handling low level hardware communications
  - It is compiled program that is loaded after startup
    - It can update registries and send and read messages from hardware bus
    - It passes control to user programs and gain back control using inxt instruction address
- How it deals with hardware?
  - It discovers hardware by sending messages on the bus
  - Gets the ability to talk to any hardware with drivers
    - OS have standard interfaces on talking to categories of devices
    - Drivers tranlsate hardware instructions to fit these standard interfaces
      - Hardware OS needs like mouse, keyboard and monitory need to fit these
      - Specizlized hardware need not. Some someware can sent just raw messages
- Components
  - Hardware interface
  - Processes management
  - Device management
  - File system
  - Network management
  - Graphical user interface
- What are processes?
  - A compiled program in action
  - OS gives switch to this code and gain back control with interrupts
  - OS creates an information space in memory for a process that contain details
    - Code
    - Stack
    - Heap
- How GUI works?
  - GUI is another process communicating with other processes
    - GUI's memory space has what is displayed on screen (the windows and other widgets)
    - Processes sent messages to GUI to create window and add thigns to window
      - Lots of defaults and customizations there
    - GUI process gets inputs from keyboard, mouse, touchscreen etc.
      - Determines which process to pass the event to passes events
      - Proceess should have registered handlers with the OS for handling
