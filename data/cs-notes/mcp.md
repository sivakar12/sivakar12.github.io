title: MCP (Model Context Procotol)
---
- What is MCP?
  - Giving tools and information to model so we can give it context about us and tools to execute
  - As long as an AI component provide an interface to MCP, any piece of software can talk to any others
  - Solves the M x N problem
- Primitives
  - Tools
  - Resources
  - Prompts
- Components
  - Server
    - An independent process in host's computer or remote server that provides tools and resourses and prompts
    - Give code and configuration to an SDK and then you can run a command to start a process
  - Client
    - In the host, for each connection to a server, a new client is created
    - Manages the protocol level things
      - Serializing and deserializing
      - Getting a list of tools availabing by querying
    - List of clients is given to host in configuration file as a JSON file
      - Can give a SSH link or the command to run locally
  - Host
    - Any someware that uses AI models and wants to connect to MCP services
    - Has access to an LLM
    - Gets the inputs from users, gets information from MCP servers and coordinates the messages with LLM
    - If LLM wants to make a tool execution, it will give information to host, host calls the tool through MCP
    - List of MCP given to 
- How to identify an MCP
  - From a remote URL
  - The command, with a path to file, to call and run the process locally
    - Here the STDIO is used to communicate
- SDK
  - Python
  - JavaScript
