- What is git
  - Storing snapshots(commits) of project directory with links for parent commit
  - For version control and collaboration
- Uses
  - Easily to experiment knowing you can reset to working state
    - Have multiple branches in parallel
  - Many users work at the same time
    - Everyone has their own separate local repository, which they sync with a remote
  - Visual examination of the changes
  - Maintain multiple versions of the code
  - Allows CI/CD
- Concepts
  - commit
    - a snapshot of the project directory
    - has author, parent commit, title and description (optional)
    - identified by a hash
    - many things can point to a commit (hash)
      - head
      - a branch
      - a tag
  - staging area
    - files are added to staging area before being committed
  - branch
    - a pointer to a commit actually
    - you create a new branch to get a new pointer
    - When you commit, the pointer advances to the new commit
      - but not for the other branches
  - remote
    - another version of this repository over a network to which changes can be synchronized
  - stash
  - head
    - reference to the current commit
    - when you commit, the head also advance to the latest commit
  - __merging__ and different situations
    - happens in different circumstances
      - apply changes from different branch to this
      - bring change from a remote branch (pull)
    - When different files are changed since the last common commit
      - newest files from both branches are used
      - a new merge commit is created
        - this has two parent commits
    - When a file is changed by both branch since last commit
      - Tries auto merging, but if the software cannot, file with both code as put in workign director
      - You have to choose the code, add to staging area and commit
    - Rebasing
      - End result is same as merging but flattened to one line
      - Changes are interleaved which might produce code that is not inconsidtent in the middle commits
- Commands
  - add
    - add file or files to the staging area
  - commit
    - make a commit out of the staged files
  - push
    - push changes from a local branch to a branch in a remote
  - pull
  - stash
- Internals
  - Not storing changes but full directory
    - Each file is stored as object identified by a cache
      - If a file doesn't change same hash is used
  - Identification of objects using hash
    - A file is identified by a content hash
    - A commit is identified by a hash
      - Hash of multiple fields
        - File tree
        - Commit message
        - Author information
- User management
