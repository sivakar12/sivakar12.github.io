- What is git
  - Snapshots of project directory with links for history for version control and collaboration
- Uses
  - Easily to experiment knowing you can reset to working state
    - Have multiple branches in parallel
  - Many uses work at the same time
    - Everyone has their own separate local repository, which they sync with a remote
  - Visual examination of the changes
  - Maintain multiple versions of the code
  - Allows CI/CD
- Concepts
  - commit

    - has author, parent commit, title and description (optional)
  - staging area
    - files are added to staging area before being committed
  - branch
    - a pointer to a commit actually
    - you create a new branch to get a new pointer
    - when you commit, the pointer advances to the new commit
      - but not for the other branches
  - remote
    - another version of this repository over a network to which changes can be synchronized
  - stash
- Commands
  - add

- Internals
  - Not storing changes but full directory
    - Each file is stored as object identified by a cache
      - If a file doesn't change same hash is used
  - Identification of objects using hash
    - A file is identified by a content hash
    - A commit is identified by a hash
      - Hash of multiple fields
        - File tree
        - Commit message
        - Author information
- User management
