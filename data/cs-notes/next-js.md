title: Next.js
---
- What is Next.js?
  - A framework to build websites which improves over vanilla React, with special features for server-side rendering
- What features does it provide?
  - Server-side rendering boilerplate is reduced
  - Easy to use routing system based on file path
  - Can be incrementally added to a project
- Different types of rendering
  - SSG (Static Site Generation)
    - Build all pages in the website and serve from CDN/file server
      - Parameterization possible
    - Page for the link is rendered but other pages after clicking links are dynamically added
      - JavaScript is hydrated later
  - SSR (Server Side Rendering)
    - Page for each route is rendered in the server where the required JavaScript runs
    - HTML is returned to the client
  - Client Side Rendering (CSR)
    - Normal React
      - Components at the bottom of the tree usually can behave this way
  - Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
    - Some websites with too many pages take a long time to build and deploy and occupy a lot of space
    - Here pieces of the page are build as requests for them come
    - Cache and invalidation of cache
- "pages" directory
  - Oiriginal way to do things. Still used after new method is here
  - A react component exported from a file, becomes a page
  - Route based on the path of the file.
    - index.js is accessible by the route of the folder
  - API routes
    - pages/api/ folder has functions that work like Node.js server controllers
  - getServerSideProps
    - For SSR
    - A function of this name has to be exported for SSR components
    - This function runds for every requests and what it returns is passed to the client render
  - getStaticProps
    - This is run at build time for SSG pages
  - getStaticPaths
    - Used with getStaticProps to build a batch of parameterized pages in SSG
    - A file in a parameterized path has this that returnes a list of what the parameters are
    - Then for each, this is passed to getStaticProps to generate the page
  - useEffect
    - You can use this to get data from server but this is not using server side rendering
- "app" directory
  - Multiple levels of nesting
  - page.tsx file in a route is what is rendered
  - layout.tsx can be added at any point in the view hierarchy and applies as a wrapper at that level
  - loading.tsx and error.tsx also work like that
  - Uses React Server Components and Suspense
    - Suspense is a way to render components "that might not be avilable"
      - A fallback is provided
      - Server Compoents fit here well
    - A server component is run in a server and HTML is returned later
  - SSR
    - No need for special methods
    - The export is an async component
      - The async functions are run in server and the component is rendered and passed to the client
  - SSG
    - You can have a generateStaticParams function in a parametereized route
      - The pages are used for each of the item
  - "use client"
    - All compoennts are server components by default. You have to mark client components
    - Server components can have client components but not the other way around
    - Server components can't have useState or useEffect
      - Server Components are reduced to poain HTML in the end
- Why do you need special navigation with Link?
  - You can move to other pages without loading new page 
- Hydration
- Code splitting
