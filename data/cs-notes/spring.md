- What is Spring?
  - A framework to build servers in Java with dependency injection
  - What is a server?
    - Something that listens to on a network port, receives inputs, proceses and sends output back on the port
- Dependency injection
  - Why?
    - Objects depend on many other objects
    - When you use constructors of Java you get into a mess
    - Example issues
  - How it works?
    - You define classes as beans and what they need
    - In the main function of the Java program, you initialize Spring containers
    - Spring container creates objects that are needed by reading the configuration in the runtime files
    - The initialized beans in the Spring runtime has access to the things they need
    - You want some bean, you can ask from runtime (but not really used)
    - Spring has an elaborate initialization logic
    - Spring can load lots of things, based on what is available in the  runtime
      - If something is a maven dependency
- Common component
  - Controller
    - When spring initializer sees one, it adds the route conriguration to its routing system nad forward the requests
    - It can map the variables 
  - Repositories
    - You just tell what Entity (Plan Old Java Object) and Spring loads the beans that are Data Access Objecgts
  - Database connection
    - Spring reads the database configurations and establishes connections and injects access references
  - Security
    - You give pieces of configurations as beans. Spring uses them and gives them to its own beans.
- Ways of configuring
  - properties files
    - Different files for different profiles
      - Profiles are dev, production, testing etc.
    - Beans
      - @Service, @Controller
    - Just add libraries to pom.xml
