title: CI/CD
---
- What is CI/CD?
  - We work on editing the code only and the deployments happen automatically
- Tools Needed
  - Repository
    - Single source of truth
  - Pipeline
    - Steps that are executed on commit, merge, pull request etc.
  - Automated testing
  - CI/CD Provider
- Environment
  - A running instance of the application
  - We need different environments for local, development, staging and production
    - We have an application tested in dev and then in staging before allowing it in production
    - Very frequent updates in dev, less as we go in the hierarchy
- Variables and Secrets
  - We can store on multiple levels
    - Organisation level
    - Repository level
    - Environment level
  - Precedence based on what is closest
  - .env files for local
    - .env is not commmitted in the repository. .env.example is commited.
  - Names in uppercase with words separated by underscores
    - No mention of environment in names. For each enviornemnt, same names are used.
    - There should be a variable called ENV that is the environment
  - How to version control the requirements and types of the variables and secrets?
