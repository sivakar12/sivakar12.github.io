    - defer
    - Procotols
    - Delegates
    - Closures
      - To get a closure from named function,
        - remove func keyword and function name
        - move the opening brace to the beginning
        - after tye types, put an in keyword
      - Can remove names and use $0, $1, etc.
      - Can remove return
      - Trailing closure
        - If a closure is the final argument of a function, that can stand outside the parantheses
    - Structures
    - Properties
    - argument labels in function
    - Tuples have lables
    - weak reference
      - the memory management counter doesn't count this reference
      - this way the original variable can be removed from memory even if this particule referring object exists
