title: React State Libraries

- What are the things?
  - Basic state
    - Each component can have a state
    - State when changed causes the component and children to rerender
    - State can be encapsulated in a component.
    - In some situations state being all over the place is hard to maintain with lots of props passing
    - With hooks, useState and useReducer is available
      - useState for simple state update
      - useReducer when changes affect complex objects
  - Redux
    - Big picture
      - Make one or more store
      - Access parts of the store any component directly
      - Dispatch events to store from anywhere that updates the store state
      - Store updates caues the components that use the state to rerender
    - Reducer, actions and store
      - Reducer is a pure function that takes in the state and actions and return new state
        - Usually there is a switching logic based on action name
      - Action is like event name and payload
        - Action creators are sometimes-useful functions that tkae parameter and return action objects
      - Store is data stored like react state in a high level component and dispatched events edit this
    - Before hooks
      - State is created an a provider wraps the component tree
      - Components are wrapped by a function and the required part of state and dispatcher function are received by the component as props
    - After hooks
      - Make a provider
      - Get the part of store and the dispatch function by calling a hook
  - Redux Thunk
    - Basic redux is all pure functions and no side-effects
      - The actions are plain objects that are dispatched immediately
    - With Redux Thunk, actions need not be objects and can be functions that when excuted produce data object actions asynchrnously
      - The events go to the store as dispatch when they are complete
  - Redux Saga
    - Saga is a primitive that does work and waits for things
      - A generator functin
      - Generator can pause execution and resume execution when what it waited for is available
      - If it yields for an action, is is paused and when that action happens, it executes
      - It can yield other sagas
      - It can yield
  - Redux Toolkit
    - A library to reduce boilerplate with redux, creating action creators, reducers and thunk actions automatically
    - Break store into components like slices
      - You create slices first
      - Combine slices into store
      - Give the store to the store provider on top of the component tree
    - Slices can contain state and reducers
      - State is basic JavaScript object
      - Reducer is a function. Use normal JavaScript syntax but mutation doesn't happen
    - From the file, you export reducers and action creators
      - You give the slice configuration to a function createSlice and it gives you reducers and action creators
    - In the consuming components, you can get dispatcher and staet from hooks useDispatch and useSelector
    - Side effects with thunk
      - useAsyncThunk crates a thunk with a name globally
      - in a slice, in the section extraReducers, you can add event handler for the success, loading and error cases of a thunk that can update the slice state from the return of the thunk
      - Thunk is not connected to a slice but slices react to events from thunk
      -
  - Zustand
    - Simpler than Redux toolkit where you don't need a provider
    - Create a store in a file and export as object. This is a singleton.
    - State and functions are put together
