title: Programming Languages
---
- What is a programming language?
  - Something between human language and machine language
  - Programming language to human language is a set process
  - Human language to programming language is art
- What is machine language?
  - CPU instructions are fixed size and binaries 
  - They are executed one after the other
  - They decide on which circuits to use on which binary inputs
  - Example instructions
    - Load value from register
    - Set value to registers
    - Read value from memory (RAM) address
    - Send value to I/O device
- Obviously, it is difficult to code with machine language
- How programming languages simplify over machine language?
  - Use variable names to keep track of memory addresses
  - Make high level data structures and functions that are deterministically transformed to machien instructions
    - Examples
      - if condition is basically severl machine instructions
        - calculate this boolean value to this meorty address
        - if true jump to this memory address
        - if false jump to this memory address
        - in the end of true and false part, jump to the outter address
  - Allows for evolving layers of abstraction
- How different programming languages are possible? What support does operating system give?
  - There are ways to invoke OS functions
    - A C program, can get C libraries that operating system allows
      - Create things on heap
      - Read/write from file
      - Spawn and talk to other processes
    - Other compilers also turn to programs to machine code
    - Interpreters are native programms, that read code from source language to   
- Compiling
  - Turn to machine instructions
  - Different for different CPU/Operating System combinations
  - Once compiled, thigns are fast
- Intrepretors
  - There is a runtime that is a native program which read the code and decides what to do
    - Read teh code and add things to heap memory 
- Different types of programming languages
  - Sequential/Scripting languages
    - Basic data structures
    - All about if-then, while/for loops, functions
  - Object oriented
    - Objects are data and functions that are in the heap with a lot of connections
    - Template approach when there is a lot of sharing involved
  - Functional
    - Less computer hardware and more mathematical
    - Description of data and process
    - Compiler/runtime takes care of turning that to steps
- What makes a programming language fast?
- What makes a programming language easy to read?
- Features
  - if/then
  - while
  - functions
  - error handling
  - Type System
  - Functons as values
  - Monads
    - For async
    - For error handling
