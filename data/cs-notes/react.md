- What is React?
  - A JavaScript library that makes rendering HTML elements with state data easy
- How it works
  - There is one root components that have many components
  - A component may have state, which are passed to children any level deep as props
    - Props are managed as function variables
  - React executes all componets rendering steps to make a DOM tree and render
  - Updates to state has to happen through the React runtime
  - When state changes, 
    - React creates another whole render in memory 
      - but no DOM update
    - compares snapshots of old DOM state and new DOM state efficiently
    - Updates the parts of DOM that has to change
  - Event handlers are what changes the state
    - They are added to elements
      - React has a set of definitions
    - Event handlers passes from top to bottom through props
      - So events can go up and update state above
  - There are many features added on top of this.
- Benefits over directly dealing with DOM
  - No need to programatically change display items
      - You mark the model variable change and react changes view automatically
  - Easy to split components to many files
      - Comes with tooling that lets you import and export
      - Functions as components and props
  - Easy to reason about
    - Components are modular
  - Components are modular and self-contained
- Evolution
  - Class components and function components
    - Initally you had class based components
      - Only these could manage state
    - Pure functoinal components that only deal with props
  - Redux for state
    - React apps with only functional components and state in a global object
    - Because only using functional components gives many benefits, 
  - Context
    - Passing props many levels deep require boiler plate code. This simplified that.
  - Hooks
    - Abandoning class components and lifecycles (which were complex)
  - Suspense
- Hooks
  - useState()
  - useEffect()
  - useContext()
  - useCallback()
- Error Boundaries, Suspense, Server-Side Rendering
