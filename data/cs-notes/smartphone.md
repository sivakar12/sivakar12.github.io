- What new features did it bring?
  - Touch screen to make controls depend on the context
    - Before this devices had fixed buttons. Other phones had limited variable options.
    - Swipe gestures make searchign a lot easier
    - On screen keyboard freed up space for display
  - Location services
  - New input and output
    - Hapitc output, gyroscope, accelerometer
  - Camera
- What is an app?
  - Simple sortware, isolated and distributed trusted store, frequent updates, 
  - Apps are run and pauses and usually takes up all the screne
  - Multiple apps can be launhed and switched between quickly
- Notifications
  - Apps sent alerts and information to the common feed that uses see and get alerted about
  - Push notifications are sent from any server backing the app through channels like those of Apple and Google
- File system
  - A common files system is allowed to be used by the apps
  - Apps can also store files internally which is privete to the app
    - Music apps don't add the songs to the file system
    - Ebooks app don't always have to add the books to storage
  - The OS things are not viaible. Not mounted.
- Games
- Control centre
  - A panel to control things like volume, display, rotation, etc.
- Navigation
  - There is a launcher or home screen which is in essentially another app that knows about apps in the phone
    - Going home, takes you to this app
  - There is a way to see a gallery-like view of running app
  - Back button is handled by app
    - Android has this system of activities. Activies create activities adding to the stack. Back removes one after another.
- Media controls
  - When an app start playing something, it can give the status of the things to the OS which the OS displays to the things.
  - When OS media controls is used to play, pause or change track, the information is passed to the app
  - When 
- Links between apps
  - Some apps can register to be handlers of certain kinds of URs
  - Android has this thing where you choose which app to use as default, settings you can probably change later
  - Apps can display different screens based on what it was launched to
- Lock screen
  - Waking from standby gets to this, and after security check is completed only, other things can be accessed
    - Probably, a variable is there somewhere that checks if unlocked, otherwise no other screen is shown
    - Unlocks takes to the last app state and app is resumed
  - Types of security
    - PIN/pattersn
    - Fingerprint or face
      - How are they stored safely?
        - Apple stores in a different hardware unit. Not in RAM. So that information is one way only. Not taken out.
- Connecting to other devices
  - Sound outputs
    - Sound is output to speaker or headset or wireless device
    - OS knows what is available and presents to user
  - App specific hardware
- Camera
  - Multiple lenses and specialized GPU chips to quickly capture and apply effeccts
  - How can apps uses camera
  - They ask OS for camera acces and if permission is given frmo user, they get access to feed
  - More like they get bitmaps at some rate. Can erad the bitmap from some memory location
  - Front and back are available
- Settings
  - One place for global phone settings like network, display
  - Permissions for app level are maintained
- Keyboard
  - Keyboard is provided by OS
    - When app uses input modules that are provided by OS, OS knows that keyboards has to be opened
    - The input is passes as event to the app
  - Apps rezise when keyboard is open
  - Keyboars can input all kinds of things
  - Customized keyboards for drawing input, emoji input
  - Autocorrect
  - In OS level settings, you can see different settings for each keyboard
- Status bar and icons there
  - Battery, networks nad notification statuse aer shown
  - Smoe app hides them
    - They go and come back on sliding sometimes
- Different hardware units of the smartphone
  - System on a Chip
    - CPU, RAM, GPUs, modems
  - Battery
    - Sends information about charge
  - Camera
    - Puts the bitmap feed of the input on some place in RAM or special memory chip for faster processing
  - Gyroscope, accelerometer, compass
    - Stores events in some memory chip. OS maybe receive interrupts if it is listening for it
  - NFC
    - sending signals to read cards and stuff. Does it also receive?
  - Buttons on phone
    - Lock, volume rockers, camera
  - Ambient light sensors
  - Port
    - When something is connected an interrupt is given to OS
- Widgets and live activities
  - Both show information and clicking takes you to some place in the app
  - App has services running that send thigns to thsee
  - Widgets live in home screen and/or lock screen and live activities live aloneside notifications
    - Basically these are stored with configuration in the memory of the lock screen ahd notification apps
- Services
  - Apps can start processes that run in background
  - The services can do what?
- How OS UI components are provided to the apps?
  - Apps are giving a bitmap of the UI or telling OS to draw objects in a way OS understand?
- Gallary or Photos Library
  - iOS
    - One big steram of photos. Flat
    - Ordered in default by date added
    - Albums are somethign on top of that
    - Not available on filesystem
  - Android
    - Photos are in different places of the filesystem
- Backup
  - iOS to iCloud
  - Android to Google
  - To third party services
- How animations works?
  - Animations are basically slowing down transition of UI
  - The state of the UI change to something else. Instead of immediately changing, extrapolate and find in between states and update the screen on a short intervals to feel like naimations
  - Sometimes touch input are also shared to make the animations react immediatly to the hand gesture. 
    - Everything is about deciding at any given time what the bitmaps are
- What happens when the phone is in locked state?
  - App UI processes do not run at all. They are paused
  - Services run. 
    - Audio played are part of services. They send to sound module.
    - Listeners for things run. Maybe not frequently. But they respond to events and they may wake phone if needed.
- AI assistancts
  - Separate app like thing that run as a drawing on top of any app
    - OS which renders the things makes special cases
    - Input it passed ot models and calls made by models are offered as options or run
- Share widget
  - Apps register with the OS what they can receive
  - When share things, OS provides a list of things. 
    - Intelligent suggestions based on history and things
    - Not only app is an options, a contact inside an app, a task in an app
- Smartwatches
  - Phone can send messages through bluetooth or WiFi to control app
  - Companion apps are there
  - Smartwatches are registered to receive the notifications. Things done to the notification are received back by phone.
- System update
  - OS is made up of components and processes that are run. They are all modules. New versions come. The things are changed. 
- Foldable phones
  - Apps just tell the OS what to draw. OS can draw one app or two apps
  - Special apps can know that they are in a foldable phone and behave differently
  - Apps layout are designed so that they work on any screen sizes. Usually.
