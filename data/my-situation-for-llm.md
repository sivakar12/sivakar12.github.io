## My Career Situation

- I am a good software engineer. It might be arrogant saying so. I have my reasons.
  - I have so far in my career never had difficults with tasks given to me.
  - I can easily learn all sorts of things from programming to DevOps to deep learning to design patterns to system design
  - I spend a lot of time thinking about concepts and have internalized things
  - I am a generalist and study the world and therefore can work on any domain and good at coming up with creative solutions to problems

- Why didn't my career work out?
  - I was introverted and recluseive. I couldn't ask people for thigs.
  - I had some OCD and overthink a lot. I didn't try out a lot of things or took risks.
  - I didn't like the culture of Sri Lanka and didn't want to become like those people. I was not taken for an insider.

- What is the situation now?
 - I quit my full time job in 2021. From 2022, I am workign as a freelancer, solving interesting and hard problems but part time and that gives me time to learn more things on my own. In university also I self taught.
 - When I saw GitHub Copilot (even before ChatGPT entered the scnee), I realized programming is becoming easier and I have to do other things to make myself valuable to earn more in the future.

- What am I good at?
  - I have good command overlanguage and read for really long time and work on my own to understand and fix problems.
  - I get creative ideas. I step back from a problem when it becomes difficult and soon get ideas to solve them from different direction. I creadit my reading and observation of the world for ideas that flow easily.
  - I get into the hyper-focused flow state when I work. 
  - I can speak multiple language. I am rapidly improving my German now. I know some French. The last time I tested my English in 2021, I got 9 band score in IELTS. It has only become better since.
