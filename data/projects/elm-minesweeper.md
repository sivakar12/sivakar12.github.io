I have for a long time been fascinated by functional programming. I have never done a full project with functional style, using only immutable data structures, pure functions etc. So I took this as a challenge to see how I can model this game under functional constraints. I learned the systax, which is a lot of work but also very rewarding. 

I made use of flex methods to style thing properly. The height and width can be changed and everything stayed centered an in layout. I used emojis for the icons to keep it basic.
