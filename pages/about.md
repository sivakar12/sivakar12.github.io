[DRAFT]
Always curious, I love learning about everything under the sun. I want to become a polymath one day. 
My present day interests are computer science, economics, history, geopolitics and psychology. I have
mostly done well at school. In highscool I loved Physics and Math with came naturally to me, I 
surprisingly did well in Chemistry in which I had no interest. All of this makes me believe that
I have this ability to learn quickly and I am also able to derive commonalities between all the
subjects and pattern match. Computer science does not exist in the vaccum. It has to solve real world
problems. And I like learning about the real world and our civilization as much as possible. Right now
I care deeply about three big problems - climate change, mental health and increasing inequality.

I have been coding since I was 15. I got my first comptuer when I was 10 and was on the Internet since
I was 13. There was this problem with all the other toys I used to own. They end up broken pretty quickly.
They don't last - those mechanical things. But computers - they're different. If I do something in software,
I am not damaging anyting. It can always be reset. That is why I got to spent so much time with computers.
When I was in high school, I really liked Chemistry and Physics but there was no way I could do lab work 
or play with those things. Those are too expensive for me. But computers were different. They allowed
me to do so many things.

I read a lot of non-fiction books. I used to read a lot of fiction, but have reduced. I consuem a lot of
content of Twitter and Reddit on a variety of topics. Always looking for good idea. I study foreign 
languages. I play Sudoku.
