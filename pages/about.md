[DRAFT 2]

Always curious, I love learning about everything under the sun. I want to become a polymath one day.

I started coding when I was 15. I got my first computer when I was 10 and was on the Internet since I was 13. I didn't get to spend a lot of time with toys in my childhood. They break quickly and I don't get new ones easily. These mechanical things don't last. But computers - they're different. If I do something in software, I am not damaging anything. It can always be reset. That is why I got to spend so much time tinkering with computers. When I was in high school, I  liked Chemistry and Physics very much but there was no way I could do lab work or play with those things. Those are too expensive for me. But computers were different. They allowed me to do so many things. That is why I went into Computer Science at my university.

I have mostly done well at school. In high school I loved Physics and Math came naturally to me, I surprisingly did well in Chemistry in which I had no interest. All of this makes me believe that I can learn quickly and I am also able to derive commonalities between all the subjects and see the patterns Computer science does not exist in a vacuum. It has to solve real-world problems. And I like learning about the real world and our civilization as much as possible. Right now I care deeply about three big problems - climate change, mental health and increasing inequality.

I read a lot of non-fiction books. My present-day interests are computer science, economics, history, geopolitics and psychology. I used to read a lot of fiction, but have reduced. I consume a lot of content on Twitter and Reddit on a variety of topics, always looking for good ideas. I like learning foreign languages. I play Sudoku and similar brain-teasing games.
