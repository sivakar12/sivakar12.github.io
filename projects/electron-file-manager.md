### Background

I wanted to have a file manager with multiple tabs because Windows didn't have one. I wanted to make use of the full suite of tools
modern web development offered. 

When I am doing file transfers, there are always multiple explorer windows open alongside many copy progress dialogs. I wanted to add
tabs and then also make multiple parallel copy paste dialogs. (The copy paste thing is still not implemented)
