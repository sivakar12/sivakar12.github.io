### Background

Spaced repition is a really effective technique. I used an app called Memrise to learn a lot of vocabulary. I wanted to do something 
like that. I wanted to add a little bit of intelligence. 

I had a question answer dataset. The dataset had only one question and one answer. I used NLP to figure out the answers that could be close to the correct answer. So the options provided are quite similar. This is done by finding the similaries in a Jupyter Notebook

### Future
This can have more intelligence. It should keep track of the mistakes
